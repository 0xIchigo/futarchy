# META

### Purpose

All futarchies need a reference asset whose value they try to maximize, so MetaDAO has META.

### Distribution

To bootstrap the governance process, 10,000 META was airdropped to \~60 wallets. The remaining supply was held by the DAO's treasury.

More META has entered the circulating supply through successful governance proposals. As of May 2024, the circulating supply stands at around 15,798. 5,087 META is held by the DAO treasury and multisigs.&#x20;
