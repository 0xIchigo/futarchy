# META

### Purpose

All futarchies need a reference asset whose value they try to maximize. MetaDAO has META, whose mint is METADDFL6wWMWEoKTFJwcThTbUmtarRJZjRpzUvkxhr.

### Distribution

To bootstrap the governance process, 10,000 META was airdropped to \~60 wallets. The remaining supply was held by the DAO's treasury.

More META has entered the circulating supply through successful governance proposals, such as Collosseum's proposal to invest $250,000 in exchange for 437 META. As of May 2024, the circulating supply stands at around 15,798. 5,087 META is held by the DAO treasury and multisigs.&#x20;
