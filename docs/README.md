# Introduction

DAOs are plagued with the following:

* **Low participation:** most people don't vote.
* **Uninformed voters**: most voters don't have a deep understanding of the decision at hand.
* **Whale and insider influence**: DAO votes are often no more than rubber stamps. It's common to see a single wallet sway an entire vote.

Futarchy is an innovative governance mechanism that solves these issues. In a futarchy, it's markets rather than voters that make decisions.

Atrium is a platform for creating, managing, and participating in futarchies. It's owned and operated by MetaDAO, which is itself a futarchy.
